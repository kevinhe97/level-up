                            <p>Vera Rubin was an American astronomer who pioneered work on galaxy rotation rates. She
                                uncovered the discrepancy between the predicted angular motion of galaxies and the
                                observed motion, by studying galactic rotation curves. This phenomenon became known as
                                the galaxy rotation problem, and was evidence of the existence of dark matter. Although
                                initially met with skepticism, Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades.
                                Her legacy was described by The New York Times as "ushering in a Copernican-scale
                                change" in cosmological theory.</p>

                                CERN, and since August 2013 an honorary Professor at the University of Edinburgh. Dr
                                Gianotti has worked on several CERN experiments, and been involved in detector R&D,
