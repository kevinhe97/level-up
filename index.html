They can make and shape this world to be what they want it to be. The world seed of Minecraft gives them the greatest sandbox, but it is ultimately a place where kids can truly be themselves and find/make what they want.</p>

                            <p>When in Minecraft, kids get the ability to conform the world to their own liking. With this power, kids have the ability to design the world to their liking. Do they wish to optimize their farms and chests? Or do they want to just make a super cool base? The world is their oyster and Minecraft gives kids the ability to shape as they see fit.

                            <p>For kids, one of the greatest things in Minecraft is the ability to achieve and do what they want. This potential of goal-setting and respective accomplishment helps build confidence in kids and their abilities. This aspect of drive and fulfillment is one that builds up over time and helps kids realize their potential both in-game and outside in the classroom, on the field, or in any of their other interests.</p>

                            <p>With the wide array of material available in Minecraft, there are many things for kids to do while they’re playing - too many even. One of the best solutions to this problem is goal-based gameplay. This allows kids to break their gameplay into goals, actions, and achievements, and by doing so, gives them a more structured approach to their playtime. The goal-oriented playstyle in Minecraft could look like quests, exploration, and/or crafting, and it gives kids the ability to structure their fun while also working and progressing through their goals.</p>

                            <p>While Minecraft has plenty of opportunities to build confidence in kids through success, one of Minecraft’s biggest strengths is giving them a place to freely fail. With its virtual world build from singular blocks, Minecraft gives kids the freedom to explore, build, and invent their own creations with the rules or constraints of reality. This gives them plenty of rules to experiment with in-game, as well as give them the ability to fail and learn at their own pace without external consequences.
