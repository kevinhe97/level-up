                    <p>Level—Up is an interactive guide for parents to learn more about the potential positives of
                        Minecraft. The site features voices from both authorities and children to help share the different perspectives.</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project is to help destigmatize games by showing parents the wonders and possibilities
                        within games. The hope is that, by understanding what levels of positivity can emerge from games
                        like Minecraft, parents can help support their kids and their interests in gaming better through the silver
                        linings that they find.</p>

                                world to be what they want it to be. The world seed of Minecraft gives them the greatest
                                sandbox, but it is ultimately a place where kids can truly be themselves and find/make

                            <p>For kids, one of the greatest things in Minecraft is the ability to achieve and do what
                                they want. This potential of goal-setting and resulting achievement helps build
                                confidence in kids and their abilities. This aspect of drive and fulfillment is one that
                                builds up over time and helps kids realize their potential both in-game and outside in
                                the classroom, on the field, or in any of their other interests.</p>

                            <p>With the wide array of material available in Minecraft, there are many things for kids to
                                do while they’re playing - too many even. One of the best solutions to this is
                                goal-based gameplay. This allows kids to break their gaming into goals, actions, and
                                achievements, and by doing so, gives them a more structured approach to their playtime.
                                The goal-oriented playstyle in Minecraft could look like quests, exploration, and/or
                                crafting, and it gives kids the ability to structure their fun while also working and
                                being active in game.</p>

                            <p>While Minecraft has plenty of opportunities to build confidence in kids through success,
                                one of Minecraft’s biggest strengths is giving them a place to freely fail. With its
                                virtual world build from singular blocks, Minecraft gives kids the freedom to explore,
                                build, and invent their own creations with the rules or constraints of reality. This
                                gives them plenty of rules to experiment with in-game, as well as give them the ability
                                to fail and learn at their own pace without external consequences.

                                of players. These players set up servers for people to play on together, create custom

                            <p>Finally, all these online spaces give kids a personal space for solace. Within the world
                                of Minecraft, kids can build a virtual space to hang out with their friends. Minecraft
                                gives kids the opportunity to build a space either by themselves or with their close
                                friends for them and themselves only. This is a space where they can truly be themselves
                                and truly make irreplaceable memories.

                            <p>Through these 3 levels, the hope of this project is that parents will be able to better
                                understand why kids are so invested in Minecraft and other virtual spaces. Minecraft
                                represents escape, immersion, creativity, and exploration for these kids. It is a place
                                where they can find themselves, be true to who they are, and just be kids. It is a world
                                where memories are made, laughter is shared, and dreams are realized. There’s always a
                                new adventure on the horizon in Minecraft, and this project’s goal is to share that
                                possibility and potential to parents so that they may find their own silver linings to
                                this game.
